By using simultaneous measurement and state tomography, we demonstrated entanglement between two solid-state qubits. Single qubit operations and capacitive coupling between two super-conducting phase qubits were used to generate a Bell-type state. Full two-qubit tomography yielded a density matrix showing an entangled state with fidelity up to 87\%. Our results demonstrate a high degree of unitary control of the system, indicating that larger implementations are within reach.},

The pulse control of the biexciton dynamics, combined with previouslydemonstrated control of the single-exciton Rabi rotation, serves as the physical basis for a two-bit conditional quantum logic gate. The truth table of the gate shows the features of an all-optical quantum gate with interacting yet distinguishable excitons as qubits. Evaluation of the fidelity yields a value of 0.7 for the gate operation. Such experimental capabilityis essential to a scheme for scalable quantum computation bymeans of the optical control of spin qubits in dots.},

abstract = {In recent years materials informatics, which is the application of data science to problems in materials science and engineering, has emerged as a powerful tool for materials discovery and design. This relatively new field is already having a significant impact on the interpretation of data for a variety of materials systems, including those used in thermoelectrics, ferroelectrics, battery anodes and cathodes, hydrogen storage materials, polymer dielectrics, etc. Its practitioners employ the methods of multivariate statistics and machine learning in conjunction with standard computational tools (e.g., density-functional theory) to, for example, visualize and dimensionally reduce large data sets, identify patterns in hyperspectral data, parse microstructural images of polycrystals, characterize vortex structures in ferroelectrics, design batteries and, in general, establish correlations to extract important physics and infer structure-property-processing relationships. In this Overview, we critically examine the role of informatics in several important materials subfields, highlighting significant contributions to date and identifying known shortcomings. We specifically focus attention on the difference between the correlative approach of classical data science and the causative approach of physical sciences. From this perspective, we also outline some potential opportunities and challenges for informatics in the materials realm in this era of big data.}

abstract = {We present the Python Materials Genomics (pymatgen) library, a robust, open-source Python library for materials analysis. A key enabler in high-throughput computational materials science efforts is a robust set of software tools to perform initial setup for the calculations (e.g., generation of structures and necessary input files) and post-calculation analysis to derive useful material properties from raw calculated data. The pymatgen library aims to meet these needs by (1) defining core Python objects for materials data representation, (2) providing a well-tested set of structure and thermodynamic analyses relevant to many applications, and (3) establishing an open platform for researchers to collaboratively develop sophisticated analyses of materials data obtained both from first principles calculations and experiments. The pymatgen library also provides convenient tools to obtain useful materials data via the Materials Project’s REpresentational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API). As an example, using pymatgen’s interface to the Materials Project’s RESTful API and phasediagram package, we demonstrate how the phase and electrochemical stability of a recently synthesized material, Li4SnS4, can be analyzed using a minimum of computing resources. We find that Li4SnS4 is a stable phase in the Li–Sn–S phase diagram (consistent with the fact that it can be synthesized), but the narrow range of lithium chemical potentials for which it is predicted to be stable would suggest that it is not intrinsically stable against typical electrodes used in lithium-ion batteries.}

abstract = {Abstract Point defects in semiconductors are emerging as an important contender platform for quantum technology (QT) applications, showing potential for quantum computing, communication, and sensing. Indeed, point defects have been employed as nuclear spins for nanoscale sensing and memory in quantum registers, localized electron spins for quantum bits, and emitters of single photons in quantum communication and cryptography. However, to utilize point defects in semiconductors as single-photon sources for QT, control over the influence of the surrounding environment on the emission process must be first established. Recent works have revealed strong manipulation of emission energies and intensities via coupling of point defect wavefunctions to external factors such as electric fields, strain and photonic devices. This review presents the state-of-the-art on manipulation, tuning, and control of single-photon emission from point defects focusing on two leading semiconductor materials—diamond and silicon carbide.},

The nanoparticles were synthesized via chemical precipitation method in a single reaction vessel under ambient conditions. The prepared CdS nanoparticles were compared with the bulk CdS. The Optical properties were determined by using UV-Vis spectroscopy. The band gap from Absorption Spectra was found to be 2.66eV (470nm) while that of bulk is 2.42eV (515nm). Thermal properties were determined by DTA, TGA and DTG. The particles show good thermal stability with high melting point (~12500C). Structural and Morphological properties were analyzed by FTIR, XRD, SEM and TEM. The XRD pattern exhibit features of cubic crystal structure having morphology of octahedron and tetragonal phases.  The particle size calculated from UV-Vis Spectroscopy, XRD and TEM was well below 10 nm.},

	abstract = {As the number of novel data-driven approaches to material science continues to grow, it is crucial to perform consistent quality, reliability and applicability assessments of model performance. In this paper, we benchmark the Materials Optimal Descriptor Network (MODNet) method and architecture against the recently released MatBench v0.1, a curated test suite of materials datasets. MODNet is shown to outperform current leaders on 6 of the 13 tasks, while closely matching the current leaders on a further 2 tasks; MODNet performs particularly well when the number of samples is below 10 000. Attention is paid to two topics of concern when benchmarking models. First, we encourage the reporting of a more diverse set of metrics as it leads to a more comprehensive and holistic comparison of model performance. Second, an equally important task is the uncertainty assessment of a model towards a target domain. Significant variations in validation errors can be observed, depending on the imbalance and bias in the training set (i.e., similarity between training and application space). By using an ensemble MODNet model, confidence intervals can be built and the uncertainty on individual predictions can be quantified. Imbalance and bias issues are often overlooked, and yet are important for successful real-world applications of machine learning in materials science and condensed matter.}

abstract = {The nanocrystalline MgSe thin films were deposited onto glass substrates by spray pyrolysis method at 523 K temperature using MgCl2 and SeO2 precursors. Structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties of MgSe thin films have been studied. The structural studies revealed that the as-deposited MgSe thin films are nanocrystalline in nature with cubic lattice. The morphological investigations show that the total substrate surface is well covered by the spherical star type grains with MgSe nano-rods at some places. The optical absorption measurements confirm that the MgSe films have direct optical band gap of the order of 2.45 eV. The electrical characterizations indicate that as deposited P-type MgSe films are semiconducting in nature.}

abstract = {Tree boosting is a highly effective and widely used machine learning method. In this paper, we describe a scalable end-to-end tree boosting system called XGBoost, which is used widely by data scientists to achieve state-of-the-art results on many machine learning challenges. We propose a novel sparsity-aware algorithm for sparse data and weighted quantile sketch for approximate tree learning. More importantly, we provide insights on cache access patterns, data compression and sharding to build a scalable tree boosting system. By combining these insights, XGBoost scales beyond billions of examples using far fewer resources than existing systems.},
