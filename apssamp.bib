	abstract = {Demonstration of quantum entanglement, a key resource in quantum computation arising from a nonclassical correlation of states, requires complete measurement of all states in varying bases. By using simultaneous measurement and state tomography, we demonstrated entanglement between two solid-state qubits. Single qubit operations and capacitive coupling between two super-conducting phase qubits were used to generate a Bell-type state. Full two-qubit tomography yielded a density matrix showing an entangled state with fidelity up to 87\%. Our results demonstrate a high degree of unitary control of the system, indicating that larger implementations are within reach.},

	abstract = {We report coherent optical control of a biexciton (two electron-hole pairs), confined in a single quantum dot, that shows coherent oscillations similar to the excited-state Rabi flopping in an isolated atom. The pulse control of the biexciton dynamics, combined with previouslydemonstrated control of the single-exciton Rabi rotation, serves as the physical basis for a two-bit conditional quantum logic gate. The truth table of the gate shows the features of an all-optical quantum gate with interacting yet distinguishable excitons as qubits. Evaluation of the fidelity yields a value of 0.7 for the gate operation. Such experimental capabilityis essential to a scheme for scalable quantum computation bymeans of the optical control of spin qubits in dots.},

Finally, as new calculations are continuously added to both OQMD and Materials Project, the analysis above corresponds only to certain snapshots of each database; however, we expect this conclusion to be valid as long as the chemical-potential fitting approaches are not significantly revised.

abstract = {Abstract Point defects in semiconductors are emerging as an important contender platform for quantum technology (QT) applications, showing potential for quantum computing, communication, and sensing. Indeed, point defects have been employed as nuclear spins for nanoscale sensing and memory in quantum registers, localized electron spins for quantum bits, and emitters of single photons in quantum communication and cryptography. However, to utilize point defects in semiconductors as single-photon sources for QT, control over the influence of the surrounding environment on the emission process must be first established. Recent works have revealed strong manipulation of emission energies and intensities via coupling of point defect wavefunctions to external factors such as electric fields, strain and photonic devices. This review presents the state-of-the-art on manipulation, tuning, and control of single-photon emission from point defects focusing on two leading semiconductor materials—diamond and silicon carbide.},

  abstract     = {Bulk and surface electronic structures, calculated using density functional theory and a tight-binding model Hamiltonian, reveal the existence of two topologically invariant (TI) surface states in the family of cubic Bi perovskites (ABiO$_3$; A = Na, K, Rb, Cs, Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba). The two TI states, one lying in the valence band (TI-V) and other lying in the conduction band (TI-C) are formed out of bonding and antibonding states of the Bi-$\{$s,p$\}$ - O-$\{$p$\}$ coordinated covalent interaction. Below a certain critical thickness of the film, which varies with A, TI states of top and bottom surfaces couple to destroy the Dirac type linear dispersion and consequently to open surface energy gaps. The origin of s-p band inversion, necessary to form a TI state, classifies the family of ABiO$_3$ into two. For class-I (A = Na, K, Rb, Cs and Mg) the band inversion, leading to TI-C state, is induced by spin-orbit coupling of the Bi-p states and for class-II (A = Ca, Sr and Ba) the band inversion is induced through weak but sensitive second neighbor Bi-Bi interactions.},
